# mruby-bin-mirb-hostbased
mruby-bin-mirb-hostbased is mrbgem which allows hostbased irb with mruby.

Compiled executable "mirb-hostbased" is simular to mirb, but mirb-hostbased
works with target board via serial communication.

## Demo

## How it works
As name "hostbased" implies, mirb-hostbased does not send user input directly to
target board, rather, it compiles user input into bytecode on host machine, then send bytecode via serial.

Target boards should handle received bytecode, then send result back to host.
Sample sketch for chipKIT Max32 (and maybe for Arduino Due) is in samples/target.

# Build
## Host side:
Add below line in host Build setting of build_config.rb in mruby's source tree.

```
conf.gem :github => 'kyab/mruby-bin-mirb-hostbased', :branch => 'master'
```

## Target side:
If your board is Arduino compatible, compile and upload sample sketch file in samples/target by your IDE(MPIDE,etc).
I also recommend you to use my [mruby-arduino](https://github.com/kyab/mruby-arduino).

```
conf.gem :github => "kyab/mruby-arduino.git", :branch => "master"
```

# Usage
```
mirb-hostbased -p <port>
```
`<port>` is serial(or USB Serial) port that target connected.

Example:
```
 mirb-hostbased -p /dev/cu.usbserial-A600CKP6
```

Once prompt ">" is displayed, your target is ready. Enter any ruby code like mirb.
```
mirb-hostbased -p /dev/cu.usbserial-A600CKP6 
mirb-hostbased - Hostbased Interactive mruby Shell
  waiting for target on /dev/cu.usbserial-A600CKP6...
(taget):TOTAL_ALLOCATED : 83297
target is ready.
> 1+1
 => 2
> "mruby".upcase.reverse
 => YBURM
> exit
```

## Loading file
You can use #file special command to read *.rb files.

test.rb
```
def square_add(a,b)
  a*a + b*b
end
puts "test.rb loaded into target"
```

mirb-hostbased:
```
> #file /path/to/test.rb
test.rb loaded into target
 => nil
> square_add(2,3)
 => 25
```

## Reconnect without reset
You can reconnect to serial(usb-serial) without reset. 
With --noreset option, mirb-hostbased does not wait for target to send HELLO.

```
 mirb-hostbased --noreset -p /dev/cu.usbserial-A600CKP6
 >
```
note: You cannot reuse local variable in previous mirb-hostbased session.

###For Arduino boards:
Usually Arduino boards automatically reset when USB is (re)connected even self-powered from external power source. So to use --noreset option,
you have to disable auto-reset temporarily. 
I recommend to use capacitor hack introduced bellow.
http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/24743/arduino-resetting-while-reconnecting-the-serial-terminal.

Your sessions would be like.
```
(Arduino is default and self-powered: auto-reset enabled.)
mirb-hostbased -p /dev/cu.usbserial-A600CKP6
> def foo
*   puts "foo"
* end
 => nil
> $global = 99
 => 99
> exit
(Disconnect USB.)
...
(Connect capacitor between RESET and GND on board. auto-reset disabled.)
(Reconnect USB)
mirb-hostbased --noreset -p /dev/cu.usbserial-A600CKP6
> foo
foo
 => nil
> $global
 => 99

```#file``` command and ```--noreset``` options will provide you rapid try-and-test cycle.
